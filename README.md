# `nitrox-runtime` Docker Image
This is a docker image which downloads [Nitrox](https://github.com/SubnauticaNitrox/Nitrox) from https://nitrox.rux.gg/ and stores it in /nitrox-runtime.
The image is meant to be used in a [docker multi-stage build pipeline](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) and is useless on its own.
